# Broken App Issues
1. Asynchronous Operations Management - The code incorrectly managed asynchronous tasks. While it utilized 'map' alongside 'async' functions, it failed to employ 'Promise.all' to ensure all the promises were fully resolved.

2. 
Error Handling Issue - The error object ('err') was not appropriately forwarded to the 'next' function within the catch block, potentially leading to complications in managing errors.

3. **JSON Body Parsing- the code didn't include middleware to parse the JSON body of the request, which is necessary for Express.js to correctly handle JSON input.

4. JSON Body Parsing Oversight - The code lacked middleware for parsing JSON request bodies, a critical requirement for Express.js to accurately process JSON input.

5. Variable Declaration Inconsistency - Several variables were initialized using 'let' instead of 'const', despite not being reassigned, which would make 'const' a more suitable choice.
